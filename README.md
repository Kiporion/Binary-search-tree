# Binary-search-tree

An implementation of a binary search tree data structure written in JavaScript.

Includes the following methods:

- `insert(value)` - inserts a new node with the given value into the tree
- `remove(value)` - removes the node holding the given value from the tree
- `find(value)` - returns the node holding the given value in the tree
- `levelOrder()` - traverses each node of the tree in breadth-first level order
- `inorder()` - traverses each node of the tree inorder (deapth-first order)
- `preorder()` - traverses each node of the tree preorder (deapth-first order)
- `postorder()` - traverses each node of the tree postorder (deapth-first order)
- `height()` - returns the height of a node -- defined as the longest path between the node and a leaf node
- `isBalanced()` - returns true/false based on whether or not the tree is balanced
- `prettyPrint` - prints the tree in the console in a visualized, readable format.
